# Preliminaries: Version control

For exact reproducibility of our results we use the package manager `renv` to keep track of the versions of all packages used.

To reproduce our analysis, install `renv` then use `renv::activate()` to activate the environment specified in the lockfile. You might have to use `renv::hydrate()` to install required packages as well. Afterwards you can run the R code as you would normally do.


# Preprocessing: computing GHG multipliers for COICOP categories
We begin by loading libraries...

```{r message=FALSE}
library("haven")
library("dplyr")
library("readxl")
library("openxlsx")
library(tidyr)
library(stringdist)
library(labelled)
```

Again, we need the lcf data, this time with the added code for imputed Rent (number of rooms as proxy)
```{r}
lcf <- read_sav("../data/lcf.sav")
```

This time we can use the automatically generated and manually corrected bridging table. We do not use some of the B & C codes since their expenditures is redundantly record in other variables or since they are 0 anyway. For those the value `USE` was set to `FALSE` in the bridging table. 

```{r}
bridged <- read.xlsx("../data/bridging_matrix_edited.xlsx") %>% slice(2:n())
B <- bridged %>% filter(USE==TRUE)
```


Instead of working with a table of GHG multipliers, we now use the total GHG emissions for every category and compute the intensities per pound ourselves. The GHG emissions are available from the same data set release by Uni Leeds.
```{r}
coiold <- read_xls("../data/raw/coicop.xls")
coinew <- read_xlsx("../data/raw/ghg_coicop_2018.xlsx")
coinew <- coinew %>% separate(COICOP, c("coinum", "coistr"), " ", remove=FALSE, extra = "merge")
```



## Compute new multipliers

```{r}
# the "column names" of the used variables
uVar <- B %>% select(LCFCODE) %>% unlist %>% as.character

# extract the relevant columns, compute weighted annual expenditure
weekly_xp_hh <- lcf %>% select(uVar)
annual_weighted_xp_hh <- lcf$weighta * 52 * weekly_xp_hh 
# aggregate within LCF codes
total_xp_lcf <- annual_weighted_xp_hh %>% colSums %>% as.data.frame


total_xp_lcf$COICOPCODE <- B$COICOPCODE

# Now aggregate the LCF code totals within the COICOP categories
total_xp_coicop <- aggregate( . ~ COICOPCODE, total_xp_lcf, sum)

coinew$total_xp <- total_xp_coicop$.[match(coinew$coinum, total_xp_coicop$COICOPCODE)]

# convert values from tCO2 to kilogram 
coinew$ghg_factor <- 1000 * coinew$`2018` / coinew$total_xp
# Note that actually both the left side and the right side should be multiplied by 1000
# Left side: The date is given in ktCO2
# Right side: The population estimate of the dataset is equal to 1000 * weighta * persons_per_household
# These factors cancel out

# Avoid NaN
coinew$ghg_factor[coinew$total_xp == 0.] <- 0.


# For comparison record the GHG factor from the original data set as well
coinew$old_ghg_factor <- coiold$"GHG (kgCO2e per Â£)"

# Often this is the same, for some categories we see differences however

mean(coinew$ghg_factor / coinew$old_ghg_factor, na.rm=T)

```

## GHG emissions
```{r}
# used variables
uVar <- B %>% select(LCFCODE) %>% unlist %>% as.character

weekly_xp_hh <- lcf %>% select(uVar)

# GHG Multipliers
ghg_factor_lcf <- coinew$ghg_factor[match(B$COICOPCODE, coinew$coinum)]

# Test that multiplication works as intended
all.equal(apply(mapply(`*`,weekly_xp_hh,ghg_factor_lcf), 2, mean), (apply(weekly_xp_hh,2,mean) * ghg_factor_lcf), tol = 10e-6)
```


Consistency check: Aggregating weekly_ghg per household should be the same as multiplying total_xp per COICOP category with the corresponding ghg factor and then aggregating.

```{r}
weekly_ghg_hh <- mapply(`*`,weekly_xp_hh,ghg_factor_lcf) %>% as.data.frame

sum(weekly_ghg_hh * lcf$weighta * 52,na.rm=T) == sum(coinew$total_xp * coinew$ghg_factor, na.rm=T)

```

```{r}
#Append "GHG" for later merging

colnames(weekly_ghg_hh) <- paste("GHG", colnames(weekly_ghg_hh), sep="_")
weekly_ghg_hh$case <- lcf$case
write_sav(weekly_ghg_hh, "../data/weekly_ghg_hh.sav")
```
## Evaluation 
```{r}

# This function returns all used LCF codes that belong to a specific coicop (sub-) category

coicop_to_lcf <- function(category) {
  if (category %in% coinew$coinum)  {
    return(B %>% filter(COICOPCODE == category) 
         %>% select(LCFCODE) %>% unlist%>% as.character)
  } else {
  category = paste(category,".",sep="") 
  return(B %>% filter(startsWith(COICOPCODE,category)) 
         %>% select(LCFCODE) %>% unlist%>% as.character)
  }
}

# This function return the (weighted) total GHG (in t) emitted in a given coicop  category
coicop_to_total_ghg <- function(category) {
  CODES = coicop_to_lcf(category)
  if (identical(CODES,character(0))) {return(0)}
  stuff <- weekly_ghg_hh %>% select(paste("GHG", CODES, sep="_"))
  S <- sum(stuff* lcf$weighta * 52, na.rm=T) / 1000
  return(S)
}

# Test the above function
# ...by making sure that each category is correct
(sapply(coinew$coinum, coicop_to_total_ghg)*1000 - coinew$total_xp * coinew$ghg_factor) %>% round %>% prod(na.rm=T) == 0



```
